## 3. Design System & Brand Identity

A cohesive design system and strong brand identity are critical for SocialCraft
to stand out and provide a memorable user experience.

### Color Palette (WCAG AAA Compliant)

The color palette is designed to be vibrant, modern, and highly accessible,
adhering to WCAG AAA contrast guidelines where applicable. This ensures
readability and a pleasant visual experience for all users.

| Token | HEX | Use Case | WCAG Contrast Ratio (against `#F9FAFB` background) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `primary` | `#4F46E5` | Primary calls-to-action (CTAs), key interactive elements, brand accents. | 6.09:1 (AA) |
| `primary-dark` | `#4338CA` | Hover states for primary elements, darker brand accents. | 7.14:1 (AAA) |
| `secondary` | `#10B981` | Success states, secondary interactive elements, positive indicators. | 6.46:1 (AA) |
| `accent` | `#F59E0B` | Highlights, warnings, attention-grabbing elements. | 5.37:1 (AA) |
| `background` | `#F9FAFB` | Main page background, light sections. | N/A |
| `text` | `#1F2937` | Primary body text, headings. | 13.9:1 (AAA) |
| `text-light` | `#4B5563` | Secondary text, descriptions, subtle labels. | 8.01:1 (AAA) |
| `border-light` | `#E5E7EB` | Dividers, subtle borders for UI elements. | N/A |

### Typography

The typography selection aims for a balance of modern aesthetics and
readability. **Space Grotesk** will be used for display elements (headlines,
titles) to convey a contemporary, tech-forward feel, while **Inter** will be
used for body text, ensuring excellent legibility across various screen sizes.
These fonts will be configured in `tailwind.config.js`.

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js (excerpt)
const defaultTheme = require("tailwindcss/defaultTheme");

module.exports = {
  // ...
  theme: {
    extend: {
      fontFamily: {
        display: ["Space Grotesk", ...defaultTheme.fontFamily.sans],
        body: ["Inter", ...defaultTheme.fontFamily.sans],
      },
    },
  },
  // ...
};
```

### Logo Design Concepts

The logo for SocialCraft will draw inspiration from modern graphic design trends
for 2025, focusing on elements that reflect AI creativity, dynamism, and
trend-awareness. The goal is to create a mark that is both abstract and
minimalist, yet bold and memorable.

- **Bold Minimalism:** The logo will feature few elements but with a heavy
  emphasis on form and color. This ensures clarity and strong impact, even at
  small sizes.
- **Abstract Shapes:** Incorporating unique and dynamic shapes will add
  structure and dimension, symbolizing the fluid nature of trends and the
  transformative power of AI. An abstract 'T' and 'F' could be intertwined to
  form a dynamic, upward-pointing arrow or a stylized wave, representing
  "trends" and "forging" them into new visuals.
- **AI-Inspired Elements:** Subtle nods to AI, such as geometric patterns or a
  subtle gradient that hints at digital creation, can be integrated. The use of
  metallic hues or gradients (e.g., from primary to secondary colors) could
  evoke a sense of innovation and sophistication.
- **Subtle Icons:** If a wordmark is used, letters could be subtly transformed
  into icons that relate to the product, such as a stylized "T" that also looks
  like a graph line indicating a trend, or an "F" with a subtle spark or
  forge-like element.

The overall design will aim for a digital-native, adaptable brand identity that
performs well across various screen sizes and contexts, including integration
into AI-generated marketing materials. This strategic choice for the logo aligns
with the product's core offering and its intended use in a dynamic digital
landscape.
