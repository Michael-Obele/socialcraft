## 7. Production Hardening

To ensure SocialCraft is robust, secure, and performs optimally in a production
environment, several hardening measures will be implemented.

### Security

Security is paramount for any web application, especially one handling
user-generated content and external API integrations.

- **Rate Limiting:** To protect against abuse, brute-force attacks, and
  excessive API calls, rate limiting will be implemented on critical endpoints,
  particularly `/generate`. A library like `sveltekit-rate-limiter` can be
  integrated into `src/hooks.server.ts`. This proactive measure protects against
  denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and ensures fair usage of resources.
  ```typescript
  // src/hooks.server.ts (example using sveltekit-rate-limiter)
  import { sequence } from "@sveltejs/kit/hooks";
  import { rateLimiter } from "sveltekit-rate-limiter/server";

  const limiter = rateLimiter({
    rates: {
      "/generate": {
        IP: 10, // Max 10 requests per IP per window
        window: "1m", // Window of 1 minute
      },
    },
  });

  export const handle = sequence(limiter, async ({ event, resolve }) => {
    // Apply Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
    const response = await resolve(event);
    response.headers.set(
      "Content-Security-Policy",
      "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com; img-src 'self' data: https://*.s3.amazonaws.com; font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com; connect-src 'self' https://api.glimpse.com https://api.apify.com; object-src 'none'; base-uri 'self';",
    );
    return response;
  });
  ```

- **Content Security Policy (CSP) Headers:** CSP headers will be configured in
  `src/hooks.server.ts` to mitigate Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other code
  injection attacks. This specifies which sources of content are allowed to be
  loaded by the browser, significantly enhancing client-side security.

- **Input Validation:** All user inputs (prompts, style selections, feedback
  ratings) will be rigorously validated on both the client-side (for immediate
  feedback) and, more critically, on the server-side (`+page.server.ts` actions)
  to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.

- **Environment Variable Management:** Sensitive information such as AWS
  credentials and API keys for third-party trend services will be stored
  securely in environment variables (`.env` file) and accessed only on the
  server, never exposed to the client-side.

### Performance

Optimizing performance is crucial for a smooth user experience and efficient
resource utilization.

- **Vite/Rollup Optimizations:** The build process will be optimized using
  Vite's capabilities. Specifically, `manualChunks` in `vite.config.js` can be
  configured to split large dependencies, such as the AWS SDK, into separate
  bundles. This improves caching and reduces initial load times.
  ```javascript
  // vite.config.js
  import { sveltekit } from "@sveltejs/kit/vite";
  import { defineConfig } from "vite";
  import tailwindcss from "@tailwindcss/vite";

  export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [
      tailwindcss(),
      sveltekit(),
    ],
    build: {
      rollupOptions: {
        output: {
          manualChunks: {
            aws: [
              "@aws-sdk/client-bedrock",
              "@aws-sdk/client-s3",
              "@aws-sdk/client-rekognition",
            ],
            // Other chunks as needed
          },
        },
      },
    },
  });
  ```

- **Prisma Accelerate for Database Connection Pooling:** As previously
  discussed, Prisma Accelerate will be used to efficiently manage database
  connections to Amazon RDS. This prevents connection exhaustion in
  high-concurrency scenarios, ensuring consistent database performance.

- **Image Optimization:** Generated images stored in S3 can be further
  optimized. This could involve converting images to more efficient formats
  (e.g., WebP) or serving them through a Content Delivery Network (CDN) like AWS
  CloudFront for faster global delivery.

- **Caching:** Beyond trend data, other static or frequently accessed data can
  be cached at various layers (e.g., CDN caching, server-side in-memory caching,
  browser caching) to reduce database load and improve response times.

### Error Handling & Logging

Robust error handling and centralized logging are essential for identifying and
resolving issues in production.

- **Centralized Error Logging:** A dedicated `src/lib/server/logging.ts` utility
  will be implemented for consistent error logging across the server. This
  function will capture error details and context, enabling effective monitoring
  and debugging.
  ```typescript
  // src/lib/server/logging.ts
  export function logError(error: Error, context: Record<string, unknown>) {
    const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
    console.error(`[${timestamp}] Error: ${error.message}`, {
      stack: error.stack,
      ...context,
    });
    // In a production environment, integrate with a dedicated logging service (e.g., CloudWatch, Sentry, Datadog)
  }
  ```

- **Graceful Error Display:** User-facing errors will be handled gracefully,
  providing clear and helpful messages without exposing sensitive technical
  details. SvelteKit's error page (`src/routes/+error.svelte`) will be
  customized for a consistent user experience.

- **Monitoring and Alerts:** Implement monitoring for key metrics (e.g., API
  response times, error rates, database connection usage) and set up alerts to
  notify the team of critical issues in real-time.
